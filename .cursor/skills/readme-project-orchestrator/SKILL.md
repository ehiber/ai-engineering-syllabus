description: Orchestrate end-to-end project creation from one or two README files in ai-engineering-syllabus: create/update translations, generate .learn/solution with the solution skill, configure learn.json with the learnpack skill, and produce preview plus sharing metadata using the social-sharing skill. Use when the user asks to create a new project from README instructions.

# README Project Orchestrator

## Purpose

Use this skill to build a complete project folder under `content/projects/<slug>` from README input, applying existing specialized skills in a safe order.

This orchestrator must cover:

1. README translation (if missing or requested)
2. Solution generation
3. `learn.json` configuration
4. Social-sharing preview and sharing metadata

## Inputs required

- `source_readme_path` (required): path to source README
- `source_readme_es_path` (optional): Spanish README path
- `target_slug` (required): final project slug
- `target_projects_root` (default): `content/projects`

If `source_readme_es_path` is missing, infer translation direction from the source file name and generate the counterpart README.

## Workflow

### Phase 0 - Prepare target project folder

1. Create target folder:
   - `content/projects/<target_slug>/`
2. Ensure structure exists:
   - `README.md`
   - `README.es.md`
   - `.learn/solution/`
3. Copy provided README files as initial content.

### Phase 1 - Translation (if needed)

Apply the repository translation rule:

- If source is `README.es.md` (or equivalent), generate/update `README.md` in English.
- If source is `README.md`, generate/update `README.es.md` in Spanish.

Do not change markdown structure, links, code blocks, or section layout.

### Phase 2 - Generate solution (specialized skill)

Use the project solution skill:

- Skill: `project-solution-generator/SKILL.md` (project solution file workflow)
- Create/update `.learn/solution/README.md` as canonical solution entry.
- Add any additional solution artifacts only if required by the project type.

Minimum expected output:

- `.learn/solution/README.md`

### Phase 3 - Configure `learn.json` (specialized skill)

Use the LearnPack config skill:

- Skill: `learnpack-learn-json-config/SKILL.md`
- Create/update `learn.json` at project root.

Required fields baseline:

- `slug`
- `title.en`, `title.es`
- `description.en`, `description.es`
- `projectType: "project"`
- `difficulty`
- `duration`
- `technologies`
- `translations: ["es", "en"]`
- `solution`
- `preview`
- `batch`

Keep values consistent with README scope and rubric.

### Phase 4 - Social sharing + preview (specialized skill)

Use the social-sharing skill:

- Skill: `generate-project-social-sharing/SKILL.md`
- Generate `.learn/preview.png` for the **target project only**
- Update `learn.json.preview` with the raw GitHub URL
- Generate/refresh bilingual `learn.json.sharing`

This phase is **mandatory** for every new project created with this orchestrator.

Recommended execution for single-project scope:

1. Generate preview image directly from the cover template (target project only):

```bash
npx playwright screenshot --viewport-size=1024,576 "file://<repo-root>/assets/cover/cover-template.html?title=<url-encoded-title-en>&author=by%204Geeks%20Academy&image=<url-encoded-image-path>" "content/projects/<target_slug>/.learn/preview.png"
```

2. Set in `content/projects/<target_slug>/learn.json`:

```json
"preview": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4GeeksAcademy/ai-engineering-syllabus/main/content/projects/<target_slug>/.learn/preview.png"
```

3. Add or refresh `sharing` with at least 2 bilingual entries (`en` + `es`) and project URL based on `<target_slug>`.

If you choose to run the automation script from `generate-project-social-sharing`, you must ensure the change set is limited to `content/projects/<target_slug>/...` and avoid unintended updates to other projects.

Safety rule:

- Do not run global regeneration across all projects unless the user explicitly requests it.
- Apply social-sharing only to the target project.

## Validation checklist (must pass)

- [ ] `README.md` and `README.es.md` both exist and are aligned.
- [ ] `.learn/solution/README.md` exists and matches project requirements.
- [ ] `learn.json` is valid JSON and includes `solution` and `preview`.
- [ ] `.learn/preview.png` exists and is not an empty placeholder.
- [ ] `learn.json.sharing` exists with bilingual (`en`, `es`) messages.
- [ ] All URLs in `learn.json` point to `content/projects/<target_slug>/...`.
- [ ] Phase 4 was executed (preview generated + sharing updated) before finalizing.

## Response format after execution

Return a concise report with:

1. Created/updated files
2. Translation actions performed
3. Which specialized skills were used per phase
4. Final validation status
