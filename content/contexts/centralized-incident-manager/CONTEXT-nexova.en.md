# CONTEXT — Centralized Incident Manager · Nexova

## Your Company

**Nexova** is a human resources consulting and talent acquisition firm with **120 employees**, headquartered in Valencia, Spain, with an expansion office in Miami, Florida. It operates across three business lines: executive and mid-management headhunting, customer support team outsourcing for technology companies, and corporate training in soft skills and leadership.

As part of the **Nexova AI Engineering** team, you have been building the internal platform across several milestones. This project integrates a centralized incident manager into that platform. At Nexova, incidents are not just infrastructure failures: they also include complaints from corporate clients, errors in selection processes, and issues from the outsourced support team.

## Who Uses It and Why

**Sergio Molina (CTO)** needs centralized visibility into all technical and operational issues that currently arrive by email, Slack, or word of mouth. Without a structured record, he cannot measure or improve resolution times.

**Roberto Díaz (Customer Support Lead)** manages 30 agents handling incidents for Nexova's clients. They currently work with a legacy helpdesk and no centralized knowledge base. This manager is the first step toward a structured system.

**Laura Mendoza (CEO)** wants to know how many critical incidents are open right now, from which office they originate, and how long they have been unresolved.

## Nexova Offices

The `branch` field must contain exactly one of the following values:

| Database value | Display name |
|---|---|
| `central` | Central (Valencia / Miami) |
| `valencia_headquarters` | Valencia — Headquarters |
| `valencia_operations` | Valencia — Operations |
| `miami_office` | Miami Office |
| `remote` | Remote (no fixed office) |

When the origin is `internal` or `customer` and does not correspond to a specific office, use `central`.

---

## Incident Categories

The `category` field must contain exactly one of the following values:

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `technical_failure` | System or technology tool failure (ATS, HubSpot, Zendesk, infrastructure) |
| `process_error` | Error in an operational process: selection, onboarding, training, billing |
| `client_complaint` | Complaint or claim from a corporate client about the service provided |
| `candidate_issue` | Issue reported by or related to a candidate in a selection process |
| `staff_issue` | Internal HR incident: absence, conflict, accident, sick leave |
| `sla_breach` | Breach of a committed SLA with a client |
| `data_quality` | Error or inconsistency in candidate, client, or reporting data |
| `other` | Any incident that does not fit the categories above |

---

## Status and Lifecycle

| Value | Meaning at Nexova |
|---|---|
| `open` | Incident registered, no owner assigned yet |
| `in_progress` | Assigned to a team or person, actively being handled |
| `resolved` | Resolved and confirmed by the reporter or the responsible person |
| `discarded` | Registered in error, duplicate, or out of scope |

Valid transitions: `open → in_progress`, `open → discarded`, `in_progress → resolved`, `in_progress → discarded`. The `resolved` and `discarded` states are final.

---

## Origins

| Value | When to use it at Nexova |
|---|---|
| `customer` | Reported by a corporate client (a company that contracts Nexova's services) |
| `branch` | Reported by staff at one of Nexova's offices |
| `internal` | Detected internally by technology, operations, or leadership |

---

## Historical Data — Seed from CSV

The CSV file from the previous project contains incidents exported from the customer support helpdesk. All of them correspond to complaints or issues reported by corporate clients (`origin: "customer"`).

**Idempotency identifier:** use the `incident_id` field from the CSV to prevent duplicate records. If that field does not exist in your CSV, use the combination `title + created_at`.

**CSV → model field mapping:**

| CSV field | Model field | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `incident_id` | — | Used only for duplicate control, not stored |
| `title` | `title` | |
| `description` | `description` | |
| `category` | `category` | Verify the value is in the allowed list |
| `status` | `status` | Verify the value is in the allowed list |
| `created_at` | `created_at` | Preserve the original date |
| — | `origin` | Always `"customer"` for all seed records |
| — | `branch` | Always `"central"` for all seed records |

Records with a `category` or `status` value outside the allowed lists are discarded and reported to the console.

---

## Expected Values After Seeding

Once the CSV is correctly loaded, the `/api/incidents/summary` endpoint must return values consistent with the validated CSV file from the previous project. Cross-check the totals by category and status against the results from the analysis script — they must match (excluding invalid records discarded by the seed).

---

## Implementation Notes

- Nexova operates in two languages: Valencia staff work in Spanish and Miami staff in English. If you implemented bilingual support in previous milestones, the form and error messages must respect that here too.
- Incidents of type `sla_breach` are critical for Roberto and Laura: although the automatic alert is not part of this project, design the data model so that filter is trivial to add later.
- The `remote` value in `branch` is common at Nexova — many employees have no fixed office. Make sure it appears clearly in the dropdown and does not create ambiguity with `central`.
