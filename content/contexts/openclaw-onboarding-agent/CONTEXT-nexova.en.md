## Onboarding instructions

The agent delivers these instructions to the new hire at step 7, after identity verification:

> Hi! I'm Nexova's onboarding assistant. To complete your registration in our systems, please provide the following information one step at a time:
>
> 1. What is your full name as it appears on your national ID or passport?
> 2. What is your tax identification number? (NIF or NIE for Spain-based staff; Tax ID for Miami-based staff)
> 3. Which office will you be primarily working from? (Valencia / Miami)
> 4. What username would you like to use for Nexova's internal systems? (no spaces or special characters)
> 5. Confirm that you have read and accepted the Code of Conduct and provide the date you did so.
> 6. Confirm that you have had your welcome session with your manager and provide their name.
>
> Once I have received all your responses, your onboarding will be marked as complete and I will let Patricia know.

## Required deliverables and how the agent verifies each one

| # | Deliverable | What the agent expects |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Full name | Free text (first and last name) |
| 2 | Tax identification number | NIF / NIE / Tax ID (free text) |
| 3 | Primary office | "Valencia" or "Miami" |
| 4 | Chosen username | Text with no spaces or special characters |
| 5 | Code of Conduct confirmation | Explicit confirmation + date (e.g. "Accepted on 8 May") |
| 6 | Welcome session confirmation | Explicit confirmation + manager's name |

The process is marked as **complete** when the agent has received a response to all six points.

## Business rules

- The username may not contain spaces or special characters. If the response does not meet the format, the agent must ask again before recording it.
- The tax identification number may be a NIF or NIE (for Spain-based staff) or a Tax ID (for Miami-based staff). The agent accepts any format without validating its structure.
- The process cannot be marked as complete if the tax ID or the Code of Conduct confirmation are missing, as both have legal implications.
- Patricia uses the daily summary primarily to identify employees in "not started" status: people who have been reported by HR but have not yet contacted the bot one or two days before their start date.
