## The company

HealthCore operates 12 outpatient clinics in the United States (Texas, Florida, Georgia) and the United Kingdom (London and Manchester). Onboarding clinical staff involves mandatory regulatory compliance requirements: no staff member may access systems containing patient data until they have completed the required training in HIPAA (US) or UK GDPR (UK). Diane Foster (VP of People, Austin) is the HR lead and the person who interacts with the agent.

## Onboarding instructions

The agent delivers these instructions to the new hire at step 7, after identity verification:

> Welcome to HealthCore. To complete your onboarding, please provide the following information one step at a time:
>
> 1. What is your full legal name as it appears on your professional licence or ID?
> 2. Which clinic and country have you been assigned to? (e.g. "Austin Clinic 2, US" or "London North, UK")
> 3. What is your professional licence number? (If you are in an administrative role, reply "N/A".)
> 4. What is the expiry date of your professional licence? (Skip this step if you answered N/A above.)
> 5. Confirm that you have completed the mandatory compliance training module (HIPAA for US staff, UK GDPR for UK staff) and provide the date of completion.
> 6. Confirm that you have received your system login credentials from IT and provide the date you received them.
>
> Once I have received all your responses, I will mark your onboarding as complete and notify the People team.

## Required deliverables and how the agent verifies each one

| # | Deliverable | What the agent expects |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Full legal name | Free text (first and last name) |
| 2 | Assigned clinic and country | Clinic name + country (e.g. "Austin Clinic 2, US") |
| 3 | Professional licence number | Number, or "N/A" for administrative roles |
| 4 | Licence expiry date | Date, or skipped if step 3 was N/A |
| 5 | Compliance training confirmation | Explicit confirmation + date (e.g. "Completed 10 May") |
| 6 | IT credentials confirmation | Explicit confirmation + date received |

The process is marked as **complete** when the agent has received a response to all applicable steps based on the employee's role.

## Business rules

- The `licence_number` field is mandatory for clinical roles (physician, nurse practitioner, nurse). For administrative roles, "N/A" is accepted and steps 3 and 4 are automatically marked as complete.
- The compliance step is a hard blocker: the process cannot be marked as complete if `compliance_completed` is `false`, regardless of whether all other steps are done.
- The country determines which compliance module applies: HIPAA for US staff, UK GDPR for UK staff. The agent does not validate the content of the module — only the confirmation and the date.
- The daily summary is especially important here: Diane needs visibility on who has not completed compliance training before their first day.
