>

> 5. Confirm that you have read the Food Handling Manual and provide the date you completed it.
> 6. Confirm that you have completed the kitchen walkthrough with your supervisor and provide their name.

## Business rules

- An employee can be assigned to any of the 14 locations. The agent does not validate which one — it only records what it is told.
- The bank account number may be Colombian (savings or current account) or American (routing + account number). The agent accepts any format.
- The process has no forced deadline, but the daily summary allows Ashley to detect cases that have been inactive for more than 48 hours.
