## 🎯 Your Challenge

The backend your company has been building throughout the course is about to face real users. Before that happens, your CTO has flagged a critical concern: several API endpoints are returning raw database objects with no shape control, no field filtering, and no protection against exposing internal model fields. In a low-traffic demo environment this is invisible — at scale, it creates performance bottlenecks, security risks, and brittle client contracts.

You've been assigned to lead a backend serialization audit. The goal is not to rewrite anything from scratch, but to inspect every existing endpoint with a trained eye and bring the API up to production standards.

> Your CTO has shared the following brief:
>
> #### What we need
>
> - A written audit identifying every endpoint and its current serialization state.
> - A classification of each endpoint: which ones expose unnecessary fields, which ones lack a defined response schema, and which ones are already shaped correctly.
> - For each endpoint that needs work, a note on _what kind_ of improvement is required — not just "needs serializer", but _why_ and _what the output shape should be_.
>
> #### Minimum deliverable
>
> Every endpoint in the API must have an explicit response serializer defined before this task is considered done. No endpoint should return a raw ORM object.
>
> #### What good looks like
>
> Beyond the minimum, I expect to see payload optimization where it matters: nested relationships flattened when the client doesn't need the full object, list endpoints that return only the fields consumers actually use, and write endpoints that accept only the fields they should.

This is the kind of review that separates an API that works from an API that can be trusted. Take ownership of the full surface area of your backend and bring it up to the standard your company's frontend — and your users — deserve.

### What are serializers and why do they matter here?

Serializers define the contract between your backend and anything that consumes it. In FastAPI, Pydantic models serve this role: they validate input, shape output, and make the API's behaviour explicit and testable. Without them, your API implicitly returns whatever the ORM produces — which can include internal IDs, hashed passwords, relational noise, and unstable field names. At high traffic, this also means serializing more data than the client ever requested.

A well-designed serializer layer means:

- **Clients receive only what they need** — smaller payloads, faster responses.
- **Internal model changes don't break the API contract** — the serializer absorbs the difference.
- **Sensitive fields are never accidentally exposed** — the schema is the source of truth.

When auditing, think at three levels: _what does this endpoint receive_, _what should it return_, and _what is it actually returning today_.

### Deciding what each endpoint should expose

Before picking a schema, clarify what the consumer actually needs from that route — not from the database model.

Ask for each endpoint:

- **Who calls it?** A list screen, a detail view, another service, or a write confirmation?
- **What does the UI or client use?** Trace the frontend (or API consumer) and list the fields it reads — ignore columns the model has but the screen never shows.
- **What must stay internal?** Credentials, tokens, foreign keys used only server-side, audit timestamps, soft-delete flags, etc.

Then choose how to serialize:

| Situation                                                 | Typical approach                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Detail view needs most safe fields on one resource        | A focused schema with **explicit attributes** (e.g. `UserPublic`: `id`, `display_name`, `created_at`)                     |
| List view needs a subset or a different shape than detail | A **separate, slimmer schema** (e.g. `UserListItem` without nested relations) — do not reuse the detail schema by default |
| Many endpoints share the exact same safe projection       | One shared schema is fine — but only when the **field list truly matches** every consumer                                 |
| Returning the whole ORM object “because it works”         | ❌ Not serialized — even if FastAPI can dump all columns, the contract is undefined                                       |

**General vs explicit:** mapping a model with `from_attributes=True` is convenient when every listed field is intentional. When in doubt — lists, auth flows, or mixed consumers — prefer **naming each attribute** in the schema so the audit doc can state exactly what leaves the API. Record that target field list in `docs/serialization-audit.md` for every endpoint you change.

## 🌱 How to Start the Project

This project is built on top of your company's existing monorepo. You do not need to fork a new repository.

1. Open your monorepo in your coding environment (Codespaces or local).
2. Navigate to your FastAPI application — typically under `/apps/<your-app-name>/` or the backend folder established in previous milestones.
3. Make sure your environment is running and your existing endpoints are reachable before you begin the audit.
4. Work on a dedicated branch: `git checkout -b feature/serialization-audit`.

## 💻 What You Need to Do

### Phase 1 — Audit

> **Tip:** A practical place to start is **authentication** — routes such as register, login, and password restore/reset often carry the highest risk: a raw ORM user object can leak `hashed_password`, and auth handlers frequently echo back more than the client needs.
>
> When reviewing auth responses, these checks tend to surface problems quickly:
>
> - **Avoid returning passwords** — plain text or hashed — in any response body.
> - **Consider limiting email in auth responses** — register, login, and password-restore flows often work best when they return only what the client needs next (for example, a token, a generic confirmation message, or a safe user projection without credential fields). Email usually belongs on the request body; echoing it back in the response is worth questioning unless your audit documents why.
>
> You may want to note auth routes early in `docs/serialization-audit.md` before moving on to the rest of the API.

- [ ] List every endpoint in your FastAPI application (route, method, and purpose).
- [ ] For each endpoint, document its current response behaviour: does it use a `response_model`? Does it return a raw ORM object, a dict, or a typed schema?
- [ ] Classify each endpoint into one of three states:
  - **✅ Already serialized** — has an explicit `response_model` and the schema is appropriate.
  - **⚠️ Partially serialized** — has a response model but it's incomplete, over-exposes fields, or doesn't match what the client needs.
  - **❌ Not serialized** — returns a raw ORM object or an untyped dict.
- [ ] Record the audit results in a Markdown file at `docs/serialization-audit.md`.

### Phase 2 — Implementation

- [ ] Create or update Pydantic schemas for every endpoint classified as ❌ or ⚠️.
- [ ] Ensure every endpoint has an explicit `response_model` declared on its route decorator.
- [ ] For list endpoints: define a schema that returns only the fields consumers need — avoid returning full nested objects when a flat representation is sufficient.
- [ ] For write endpoints (POST, PUT, PATCH): define a separate input schema that accepts only the fields that should be writable. Do not reuse the response schema as the input schema.
- [ ] Ensure no endpoint exposes sensitive fields (e.g., hashed passwords, internal tokens, raw foreign keys when a nested object is available). Auth routes (register, login, password restore) must never return password fields or email in the response body.
- [ ] Where a relationship is needed in the response, decide explicitly: return the full nested object, return only the related ID, or return a flat projection — and document that decision in your audit file.

### Phase 3 — Verification

- [ ] Confirm that all endpoints continue to pass any existing tests after the schema changes.
- [ ] Manually test at least three endpoints using the FastAPI interactive docs (`/docs`) and verify the response shape matches the defined schema.
- [ ] Update the audit document to mark all endpoints as ✅ once the implementation is complete.

## ✅ What We Will Evaluate

- [ ] Every endpoint in the application has an explicit `response_model` declared.
- [ ] Pydantic schemas are defined for both input and output where applicable — input and output schemas are not conflated.
- [ ] List endpoint schemas return only the fields necessary for the consumer — no unnecessary nesting or over-fetching.
- [ ] No endpoint exposes sensitive model fields in its response schema. Auth endpoints do not return password or email fields in responses.
- [ ] The serialization audit document (`docs/serialization-audit.md`) exists, lists all endpoints, their original state, and the changes applied.
- [ ] The application continues to function correctly after all schema changes — no regressions.

> **Note:** The quality of the audit document is evaluated as a deliverable in itself. A complete implementation with no audit trail is not sufficient.
