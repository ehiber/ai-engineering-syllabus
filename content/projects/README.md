# AI Engineering Projects

Repository of hands-on projects for the **AI Engineering** program at 4Geeks Academy. Each folder is a standalone project with its own README, evaluation criteria, and (when applicable) `learn.json` for the platform.

Projects follow a pedagogical order: from web fundamentals (HTML, CSS, SEO, accessibility) and Tailwind, through company milestones and collaboration, **OpenClaw agent setup and integrations**, then TypeScript and system design, React/Next.js and AI-assisted delivery, APIs, authentication, agents, performance, telemetry, and advanced milestones.

20. **[Company financial dashboard context project](./company-financial-dashboard-context-project)**  
    Module project focused on repository stewardship: fork an existing full-stack repo, validate AI-generated project understanding, define and test actionable rules under `.agents/rules`, and generate a `memory-bank` with product, stack, and current status.

21. **[Company financial dashboard specs project](./company-financial-dashboard-specs-project)**  
    Spec-first assignment on the existing financial dashboard repo: TypeScript types aligned with `/docs`, `components.md`, and a data-contract README for a date range filter, anomaly alerts table, and B2B vs B2C revenue comparison—no React implementation.

22. **[Company financial dashboard skills project](./company-financial-dashboard-skills-project)**  
    Continue on the same financial dashboard repo: apply agent skills (`accessibility`, `vercel-react-best-practices`), explore `skills.sh` with `npx skills find`, author a custom skill under `.skills/`, and update the memory bank—targeted improvements, not a full rebuild.
