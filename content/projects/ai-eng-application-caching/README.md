## 🎯 Challenge

Your company's platform is growing. What once handled a handful of requests per day is now under real load — more users, more API calls, more complex UI interactions. The tech lead has flagged a recurring pattern in the telemetry: some endpoints are being hit dozens of times per minute with identical queries, and some components are re-rendering far more than they need to.

The mandate is clear: before the next feature sprint, the team must profile the existing application, identify the highest-value caching opportunities, and implement them. This is not about caching everything — it's about making deliberate, justified decisions about what to cache, where to cache it, and for how long.

You will work directly on your transversal project monorepo. The output is not just working code: it's a structured technical report that explains your reasoning. Engineering decisions without documentation are just guesses — the team needs to understand why each choice was made.

### 🧠 Complementary knowledge

**When is caching the right call?**
Not every piece of data deserves a cache. Before implementing anything, evaluate two axes:

- **Computation cost vs. storage cost**: is recalculating or re-fetching this data more expensive than storing a copy of it? If a query takes 400ms and runs 200 times a minute, caching is almost certainly justified. If it takes 2ms and the data changes every 10 seconds, it probably isn't.
- **Data freshness vs. performance**: cached data is, by definition, potentially stale. A product listing can tolerate a 60-second TTL. A bank balance cannot. Every caching decision is a tradeoff between speed and consistency — document it explicitly.

**Frontend caching scope**
On the frontend, two techniques apply directly:

- **Lazy Loading**: deferring the load of components or data until they are actually needed. This reduces the initial bundle size and time-to-interactive. Useful for heavy components that appear below the fold or only in certain flows.
- **`useMemo`**: memoizing expensive computed values inside a component so they are only recalculated when their dependencies change. Only apply it when profiling shows the computation is genuinely expensive — premature memoization adds complexity without benefit.

**Backend caching levels**
On the FastAPI backend, the most practical approach at this stage is **in-process cache** (a dictionary or simple cache decorator in memory) or an **external cache** like Redis. The key question per endpoint is: _does this response depend on data that changes frequently, and does it involve meaningful computation?_ Endpoints that aggregate across many rows, call external services, or run heavy filtering are the best candidates.

**TTL discipline**
Every cached value must have an expiry. No TTL means stale data lives forever. Choose TTLs based on how often the underlying data changes — not on convenience.

## 🌱 How to Start the Project

This project is built on top of your existing transversal project monorepo. You do not fork a new repository.

1. Open your monorepo in Codespaces or clone it locally.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/caching-optimisation`
3. Make sure both the frontend and backend run correctly before making any changes.

## 💻 What You Need to Do

### Frontend Analysis and Optimisation

- [ ] Audit your Next.js application and identify at least **two components or routes** that are good candidates for Lazy Loading. Document your reasoning: why is deferring this component's load justified?
- [ ] Implement Lazy Loading for those components using `next/dynamic` or `React.lazy`.
- [ ] Audit your components for expensive computed values. Identify at least **one `useMemo` opportunity** where the computation is non-trivial and the dependency array is well-defined.
- [ ] Implement the `useMemo` optimisation. Do not apply it to trivial calculations.

### Backend Analysis and Optimisation

- [ ] List all endpoints in your FastAPI application. For each one, assess: (a) how expensive is the operation? (b) how frequently is it called? (c) how often does the underlying data change?
- [ ] Identify at least **two endpoints** that meet the cost + frequency + stability criteria for caching.
- [ ] Implement caching for those endpoints. You may use an in-memory dictionary with TTL logic, `functools.lru_cache` where applicable, or a Redis-based cache if your stack supports it.
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation: if the underlying data changes (e.g., a write operation), the relevant cached values must be cleared or marked stale.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Do not cache endpoints that return personalised, session-specific, or sensitive data without scoping the cache key to the authenticated user. A shared cache key for private data is a data leak, not a performance gain.

### Technical Report

- [ ] Write a `CACHING_REPORT.md` (or equivalent) in your monorepo with the following sections:
  - **Frontend decisions**: which components were lazy-loaded and why; which values were memoized and what the measured or estimated benefit is.
  - **Backend decisions**: for each cached endpoint, document the operation cost, call frequency estimate, TTL chosen, and invalidation strategy.
  - **Tradeoffs acknowledged**: at least one explicit discussion of a data freshness tradeoff — where you chose a specific TTL and why that level of potential staleness is acceptable for this use case.
  - **What was not cached and why**: identify at least one endpoint or component you considered but decided against caching, with justification.

## ✅ What We Will Evaluate

- [ ] At least two components or routes implement Lazy Loading with documented justification.
- [ ] At least one `useMemo` is applied to a non-trivial computed value with a correct dependency array.
- [ ] At least two backend endpoints are cached with TTL-based expiry.
- [ ] Cache invalidation is implemented: cached values are cleared when the underlying data changes.
- [ ] No private or session-specific data is stored in a shared cache key.
- [ ] `CACHING_REPORT.md` is present and addresses all required sections.
- [ ] Decisions in the report are specific and justified — not generic ("we cached this because it's slow").
- [ ] At least one tradeoff (freshness vs. performance) is explicitly discussed.

> Note: The evaluation focuses on decision quality and implementation correctness, not on the number of endpoints or components cached. Fewer well-justified decisions are preferred over many unjustified ones.
