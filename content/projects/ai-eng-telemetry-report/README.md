**Before you start**: You need the `telemetry_events` table in Supabase with at least 20 rows of real events generated from the backoffice. Without real data there is nothing to analyse — generate activity in the inventory module before continuing.

## 🎯 The Challenge

> 📌 You are building on **your own fork** of the company's **[monorepo](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/ai-engineering-company-project-monorepo)** selected at the beginning of the course — not on a new repository.

The data is there. The `telemetry_events` table has real events with timestamps, event types, and properties. But raw data is not the answer — it is the raw material. Today you transform it.

The deliverable is a Python analysis pipeline and an endpoint that serves the result: the metrics for the KPIs you defined in Phase 1, calculated from the stored events, served as JSON, and ready to be consumed by any dashboard or reporting tool.

> Your tech lead sent you this message:
>
> > "We have data. Now I need answers.
> >
> > Write the analysis pipeline. For each KPI in the plan, one Python function that loads the relevant events, transforms them with Pandas, and returns a serialisable result. Then a `GET /telemetry/report` endpoint that serves them together.
> >
> > Two non-negotiable rules: first, don't calculate anything inside the endpoint on every request — the pipeline goes separately and the endpoint calls it, with cache. Second, convert timestamps to `datetime` before any grouping — if you don't, you'll get incorrect groups with no visible error, and you'll spend hours finding the bug.
> >
> > I want real metrics with a temporal dimension. A global number with no grouping context is not a metric — it's a count."

### 📚 Complementary Knowledge — The Formula for Any Report

The data stored in `telemetry_events` answers the question "what happened?". Business questions are different: "how many orders failed per day this week?" or "what event type is most frequent?". Answering them requires transformation — always in the same order:

```
load → filter → convert types → group → aggregate → serve
```

**Load** events from Supabase filtering by `event_type` and `timestamp` range — do not load the entire table.

**Filter** by the criterion relevant to that metric: only the last 7 days, only one event type, only one warehouse or clinic.

**Convert types** — timestamps arrive as strings. Doing `groupby()` on strings that look like dates produces incorrect groups without raising any error. Always convert before grouping:

```python
df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'], utc=True)
df['date'] = df['timestamp'].dt.date
```

**Group** with `groupby()` by the dimension that answers the question: by day, by `event_type`, by the value of a property inside `tags`.

**Aggregate** with `.count()`, `.sum()`, or `.mean()`. The mental formula is always:

```
METRIC = AGGREGATION(column) grouped by DIMENSION
```

`df.groupby('date')['id'].count()` — events per day. Without a grouping dimension you only have a global number; with one you have actionable context.

**Serve** the result as a list of dicts with `.reset_index().to_dict(orient='records')` — directly serialisable to JSON.

**What not to do:** calculate the report inside the endpoint on every request. If the data does not change every second, the calculation goes in a separate function called once, with the result cached.

## 🌱 How to Start the Project

1. Open your fork of the monorepo and locate `services/` (FastAPI backend).
2. Check `telemetry_events` in Supabase and confirm you have at least 20 rows with a variety of `event_type` values — if not, generate activity in the backoffice first.
3. Review your `docs/telemetry/telemetry-plan.md` — the KPIs defined there are exactly the metrics you will calculate today.
4. Follow the order: analysis functions → report endpoint → cache.

## 💻 What You Need to Do

### Phase 1 — Analysis Pipeline with Pandas

- [ ] Create `services/telemetry/analysis.py` with at least **two metric functions**, each encapsulating the calculation of one KPI from your plan. Each function must:
  - Receive `start_date` and `end_date` parameters to bound the analysed range
  - Load from Supabase only the events relevant to that metric (filter by `event_type` and `timestamp` range in the query, not in Python)
  - Load the result into a Pandas DataFrame
  - Convert `timestamp` to `datetime` with `pd.to_datetime(..., utc=True)` before any grouping operation
  - Group with `groupby()` by the appropriate temporal dimension and aggregate with `.count()`, `.sum()`, or `.mean()`
  - Return the result as a list of dicts serialisable to JSON with `.reset_index().to_dict(orient='records')`
- [ ] Each function must be **independent and side-effect free** — calling it twice with the same parameters must produce the same result.
- [ ] Do not use loops to calculate metrics — only Pandas operations (`.groupby()`, `.agg()`, `.count()`, `.sum()`, `.mean()`).

### Phase 2 — Report Endpoint

- [ ] Create the `GET /telemetry/report` endpoint in FastAPI. It must:
  - Accept optional query parameters `start_date` and `end_date` in ISO 8601 format; if not provided, default to the last 7 days
  - Call the metric functions from the analysis pipeline with those parameters
  - Return a JSON with the structure:
    ```json
    {
      "period": { "from": "...", "to": "..." },
      "metrics": {
        "metric_name_1": [...],
        "metric_name_2": [...]
      }
    }
    ```
- [ ] The endpoint **must not run the pipeline on every request** — implement a simple in-memory cache with a 60-second TTL. If the same `start_date`/`end_date` combination is requested within the TTL, return the cached result without recalculating.

### 🔵 Additional Activity — Authentication Metric

- [ ] If you instrumented the authentication flow in D47, add a third metric function that calculates the **daily login failure rate**: `user_login_failed` divided by total login attempts (`user_login_failed` + `user_login_succeeded`) per day. Include it in the endpoint under the key `auth_failure_rate`.

## ✅ What We Will Evaluate

- [ ] The file `services/telemetry/analysis.py` exists and contains at least two independent metric functions
- [ ] Each function follows the formula `load → filter → convert types → group → aggregate` in that order
- [ ] Timestamps are converted to `datetime` with `utc=True` before any temporal `groupby()`
- [ ] No loops are used to calculate metrics — only Pandas operations
- [ ] Each function returns a list of dicts serialisable to JSON
- [ ] The `GET /telemetry/report` endpoint accepts optional `start_date` and `end_date` and defaults to 7 days
- [ ] The endpoint returns JSON with the structure `{ "period": {...}, "metrics": {...} }`
- [ ] The endpoint has an in-memory cache with a 60-second TTL — it does not recalculate on every request
- [ ] The returned metrics have a grouping dimension — they are not global numbers without context

## 📦 How to Submit

1. Make sure the changes are in your fork: `analysis.py` in `services/telemetry/` and `GET /telemetry/report` endpoint in `services/`.
2. Create a Pull Request against the main branch of the monorepo with the title: `[W17D49] Telemetry Report`.
3. In the PR description, include:
   - The name of the two metrics implemented and the business question each one answers
   - A sample of the JSON returned by `GET /telemetry/report` with real data
   - Whether you implemented the authentication metric
