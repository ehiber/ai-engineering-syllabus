# In-Class Example — Securing a Plant Swap API

> **Instructor note:** This is a classroom-paced example to introduce the same concepts as the graded project (user authentication API). Use a different domain so students don't confuse it with their own work. A community plant swap platform is concrete and low-stakes — good for live coding. The goal is to work through the JWT + FastAPI pattern together, not to finish a production app.

---

## The Scenario

A small community has a FastAPI backend for listing and claiming plants that members want to swap. Right now any request — including creating, editing, and deleting listings — is fully public. Before the next version goes live, the maintainer needs the API secured: only authenticated members can post or manage listings.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tool |
|---|---|
| Framework | FastAPI |
| Auth | JWT (`python-jose`) + bcrypt (`passlib`) |
| Token scheme | `OAuth2PasswordBearer` |
| Database | SQLAlchemy (SQLite is fine for class) |
| Config | `.env` + `python-dotenv` |

Install the auth dependencies:

```bash
pip install python-jose[cryptography] passlib[bcrypt]
```

## Data Model

### User table

| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | int (PK) | auto-increment |
| `email` | str | unique, required |
| `hashed_password` | str | never store plain text |
| `is_active` | bool | default `True` |
| `created_at` | datetime | auto |

## What to Build

### User CRUD (`/users`)

- [ ] `POST /users` — register a new user. Hash the password with `bcrypt` before saving. **Public** (no token required).
- [ ] `GET /users` — list all users. **Protected**.
- [ ] `GET /users/{id}` — get one user. **Protected**.
- [ ] `PUT /users/{id}` — update a user (name or email). **Protected** — only the user themselves.
- [ ] `DELETE /users/{id}` — delete a user. **Protected** — only the user themselves.

### Auth endpoints (`/auth`)

- [ ] `POST /auth/login` — accepts `email` + `password`. Validate credentials; if correct, return a signed JWT access token.
- [ ] `POST /auth/register` — creates a user and immediately returns a token (caller is logged in on signup).
- [ ] `GET /auth/me` — returns the profile of the currently authenticated user. **Protected**.

### Token and dependency

- [ ] Create a `get_current_user` dependency that:
  1. Reads the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
  2. Decodes and validates the JWT (signature + expiry).
  3. Retrieves the user from the database.
  4. Raises `HTTPException(401)` if anything is wrong.
- [ ] Store the JWT signing secret in `.env` as `SECRET_KEY`. Never hardcode it.
- [ ] Store token expiry in `.env` as `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`.

### Route protection

- [ ] Apply `get_current_user` as a `Depends(...)` argument to every route that should not be public.
- [ ] Return `401 Unauthorized` for missing or invalid tokens.
- [ ] Return `403 Forbidden` when a valid user tries to modify another user's record.

## Mental Model: How JWT Works in FastAPI

```
1. Client → POST /auth/login  { email, password }
2. Server validates password hash → signs JWT → returns token
3. Client stores token

4. Client → GET /auth/me
   Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>
5. get_current_user dependency decodes JWT → retrieves user → passes to route
6. Route returns user data

7. Client → GET /auth/me (token expired or missing)
   Server → 401 Unauthorized
```

---

## Manual Verification Checklist

Work through these steps in the FastAPI `/docs` UI:

- [ ] Register a new user → confirm password is not visible in the response.
- [ ] Login → copy the returned token.
- [ ] Click "Authorize" in `/docs`, paste the token → call `GET /auth/me` → see your profile.
- [ ] Call `GET /users` **without** a token → confirm you get `401`.
- [ ] Wait for the token to expire (or manually set a 1-minute expiry for class) → call a protected route → confirm `401`.

## Key Concepts to Discuss in Class

| Concept | Where it appears |
|---|---|
| Password hashing | `passlib.hash.bcrypt.hash()` on registration |
| JWT structure (header.payload.signature) | `python-jose` token creation |
| `OAuth2PasswordBearer` | Token extraction from `Authorization` header |
| FastAPI `Depends()` | `get_current_user` injected into routes |
| Environment variables for secrets | `SECRET_KEY` in `.env` |
| `401` vs `403` | Missing token vs. wrong user |

## Discussion Questions

1. Why do we hash passwords instead of encrypting them? What is the practical difference when a database is breached?
2. The `get_current_user` dependency raises a `401` if the token is expired. Should the client be able to renew the token automatically, and how would a refresh token pattern work?
3. Right now, `GET /users` returns all users to any authenticated user. Is that appropriate? What would you change if you wanted only admins to see the full list?
