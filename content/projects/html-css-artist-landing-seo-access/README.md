## Your challenge

You've decided to dive headfirst into the world of AI Engineering. And while you're learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and SEO, your first opportunity to build a _website_ has come up — for an artist friend who needs to get noticed and showcase their talent.

You're just getting started, so you'll create an initial version that you can grow later on, but that doesn't mean it won't be quality work — especially if you do it alongside AI. So give it your best! 😁

After talking with your friend, you both decide to start with a first version that gives them an online presence. It will be a single page, functioning as a landing page, that should have a navigation bar with main links (about me, career, upcoming shows) leading to the different content sections. And like any good book, it needs a great cover — so you'll also need a first section that welcomes visitors to the website.

Each section should take up approximately the full height of a computer screen, as if viewing one page at a time.

And keep in mind that on the internet there are two very important things:

1. Not everyone has the same visual capabilities, so it's important to identify elements with accessibility labels so that people with visual impairments or screen reader users can navigate the site.
2. Search engine indexing is crucial so people can find you, so don't forget SEO principles and add the markup you see fit, using both semantic HTML and Schema.org.

## 🌱 How to Start This Project

Do not clone this repository because we are going to be using a different template.

We recommend opening `the html template repository` using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended). Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer using the git clone command.

This is the repository you need to open or clone:

```text
https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-hello
```

**Please follow these steps on** [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-start-a-project).

💡 Important: Remember to save and upload your code to GitHub by creating a new repository, updating the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and uploading the code to your new repository using the `add`, `commit` and `push` commands from the git terminal.

## 📝 Instructions

Before you start developing, determine from the problem statement **what structure you agreed on with your artist friend**: which sections exist, how they are ordered, and what content each one has. Think of the page as a set of **boxes** (header, hero, about, career, shows, footer) and plan the layout from the outside in.

This will allow you to build a **strategy** and use **semantic HTML** (e.g. `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) so the structure has meaning for both users and search engines.

> **Note:** The website should be visually appealing; you can use Flexbox for layout, keep CSS DRY, and optionally use a methodology like BEM. As a bonus, add animations if you like.

## 💻 What You Need to Do

To fulfill your friend's request:

- [ ] **Structure:** Create a single HTML document (`index.html`) with a clear hierarchy: document outline, navbar with links to sections (about me, career, upcoming shows), hero section, and one full-height section per topic (~viewport height each).
- [ ] **Semantic HTML:** Use semantic tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.) so the content is meaningful and indexable. Avoid using only `<div>` for structure.
- [ ] **Layout and styles:** Use a separate CSS file (`styles.css`). Prefer **Flexbox** for layout; avoid `float` or `display: inline-block` for page structure. Keep styles maintainable (DRY, clear selectors).
- [ ] **Accessibility:** Add labels and roles so screen reader users can navigate: `aria-label` where needed, `alt` on images, correct heading levels (`h1` → `h2` → …), and focusable interactive elements.
- [ ] **SEO / Schema.org:** Add **Schema.org** structured data (JSON-LD or Microdata) that describes the artist or their work (e.g. Person, CreativeWork) so search engines can understand the page.
- [ ] **File organization:** Keep HTML and CSS in separate, correctly linked files.

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Tell the AI that you **only use HTML and CSS** for this project—no JavaScript, no frameworks. Ask it not to use a pre-made template; you are building the structure from the requirements above.

## ✅ What We Will Evaluate

- [ ] **Valid, well-formatted HTML** and correct tag hierarchy (no unclosed or misnested tags).
- [ ] **Strict use of semantic HTML** so sections and landmarks (header, nav, main, footer) are identifiable.
- [ ] **CSS quality:** Attractive, modern presentation; layout with Flexbox; organized and non-redundant styles.
- [ ] **Correct file organization:** Separate `index.html` and `styles.css`, properly linked.
- [ ] **Accessibility:** Usable with screen readers (e.g. `aria-label`, `alt`, heading hierarchy, focus management).
- [ ] **Schema.org:** Structured data (JSON-LD or Microdata) describing the artist or their work.
- [ ] **Requirements:** All agreed sections (navbar, hero, about, career, upcoming shows) present and navigable.
- [ ] **Performance (PageSpeed Insights):** Check the project public URL in [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) and achieve **at least 80 points** (ideally, **above 90**).

## 📦 How to Submit

Follow the usual submission steps to upload your repository to GitHub and share it according to your instructor's guidelines.
Include in the repository a screenshot of the PageSpeed result for the public project URL (for example, `pagespeed-result.png`).
